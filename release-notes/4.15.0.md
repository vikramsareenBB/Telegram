# 4.14.0

This is a rather minor release.

## `anyOf` and `allOf` filter combinators

[v4.11.0](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/releases/tag/v4.11.0) introduced support for filters in `Composer::on`, which allowed you to filter updates based on their content.

This release adds two new combinators to the filter API: `anyOf` and `allOf`. This will play very nicely with custom filters. For example:

```TS
import { anyOf, allOf } from "telegraf/filters";

// must match all filters
bot.on(allOf(message(), isGroup), ctx => {
  // ...
});
```

## Deprecating `hookPath`

The confusingly named `hookPath` in `bot.launch` webhook options is now deprecated. It will be removed in the next major release. You can start using `path` instead, today.

Meanwhile, we're working on new modules to add to the Telegraf ecosystem. Look forward to them, and join discussions in the official [Telegraf chat](https://t.me/TelegrafJSChat)!
